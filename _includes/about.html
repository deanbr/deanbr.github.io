              <br/>
                <p>I'm Brandon Dean, a 2015 Virginia Tech graduate with a B.S. in Computer Science.
                    I'm a Software Engineer based in Austin, TX.</p>

                <p>I enjoy working on everything from mobile to web, backend to frontend.
                    I am always learning something new, and I'm constantly reading and trying my hand at the latest in the industry.
                    So feel free to reach out if you have something in mind that's not present in my work history!</p>

                <p>In my spare time, you can find me exploring the outdoors hiking or in the ocean.
                    And when indoors, either at the gym or catching up on my favorite TV shows.</p>

                <p>Professionally, I have been working as a Software Engineer at WP Engine since June 2018.
                    Prior to that, I worked as a Software Engineer at Ikayzo in Honolulu, HI for a few years.
                    I was an Extreme Blue Intern at IBM in Raleigh, NC in the summer of 2013,
                    and I also was an intern at Virginia Interactive in Richmond, VA from Summer 2010 through Summer 2012.</p>
